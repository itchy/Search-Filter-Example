== Rails Search Filter Example

	This is a small scaffold app to demonstrate how to use a filter model to help search across multiple objects
	
	This example has a users, shifts and user_shifts tables/ActiveRecord models (but at this point only the shifts is used) and a filter model.


== Where to look
	app/controllers/shifts_controller.rb
	
	def	index
		# this is where we create the filter instance and use it to filter our results
	
	end

	app/views/shifts/index.html.erb
		# the div#search_form contains the form we uses to submit search criteria.
		# note that the url is set to shifts/index
		# and the method is set to get
		
		
	app/models/filter.rb	
		# this is a non-ActiveRecord class -- meaning it is just a basic ruby class
		# you can do fancy stuff here, but I tried to make the sample code straight forward
		# The gist is, this is an object that represents the searchable fields and performs the searching
